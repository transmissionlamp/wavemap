// First, we're going to make some variables.
// This is our "shorthand" that we'll use throughout the program:

int red = D0; // Instead of writing D0 over and over again, we'll write blue
// You'll need to wire an LED to this one to see it blink.

int green = D1;

int blue = D2;// Instead of writing D7 over and over again, we'll write led2
// This one is the little blue LED on your board. On the Photon it is next to D7, and on the Core it is next to the USB jack.

// Having declared these variables, let's move on to the setup function.
// The setup function is a standard part of any microcontroller program.
// It runs only once when the device boots up or is reset.
